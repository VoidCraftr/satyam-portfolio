Angular is a powerful framework, but large applications can suffer from performance bottlenecks if not managed correctly. In this post, we'll explore key strategies to keep your Angular apps fast and responsive.

## 1. Change Detection Strategy
By default, Angular uses `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`, which checks every component in the tree whenever an event occurs. Switching to `OnPush` can significantly reduce the number of checks.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-list',
  templateUrl: './user-list.component.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class UserListComponent { ... }
```

## 2. Lazy Loading Modules
Breaking your application into feature modules and lazy loading them ensures that users only download the code they need for the current route.

## 3. Using TrackBy with ngFor
When rendering long lists, always use `trackBy` to help Angular identify which items have changed, preventing unnecessary DOM re-renders.

## Conclusion
Performance optimization is an ongoing process. By implementing these strategies, you can ensure a smoother user experience for your specialized tools.
