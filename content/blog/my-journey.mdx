It wasn't a straight line. My path to becoming a Senior Full-Stack Engineering Leader started with a simple curiosity during my Diploma in Computer Engineering.

## The Foundation
Back in college, I learned the basics, but it was the side projects—like my "Intranet Mail System"—that taught me how software actually connects people.

## The Grind
Freelancing was my boot camp. It forced me to wear every hat: Product Manager, Designer, QA, and yes, Developer. Optimizing MySQL stored procedures for clients wasn't just about code; it was about saving them time and money.

## Leadership at NosNia.ai
Today, leading a team of 10 engineers, the challenges are different. It's less about *how* to write the loop, and more about *why* we are building this feature. Integrating LLMs into our reporting workflow required not just technical know-how, but a vision for how AI serves the user.

## Key Takeaway
Never stop building. Whether it's a small Python script or a large-scale cloud platform, the act of creation is where learning happens.
